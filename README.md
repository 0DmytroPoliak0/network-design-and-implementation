The project is organized into four main parts:

Part 1: Organizational Chart and Price Chart
Part 2: Active Directory Plan
Part 3: Implementation I (Windows Server 2022 Setup and Resource Sharing)
Part 4: Implementation II & Write-Up (Folder Redirection, Web Server Setup, and Deployment Considerations)
Project Details

Business Case
The project focuses on developing a secure and efficient network design for T-RICH. Key aspects include:

Organizational Structure: Creation of an organizational chart for T-RICH with clearly defined departments such as Top Management, Support Staff, Medical Department, and IT Department.
Cost Analysis: Development of a detailed price chart for the system’s hardware and software—including servers, laptops, printers, networking devices, and licenses.
Active Directory Design: A comprehensive plan covering the design of Organizational Units (OUs), security groups, and shared folder configurations to enforce role-based access control.
Server and Network Configuration: Setup of Windows Server 2022 for DNS, file sharing, printer sharing, and domain management.
Additional Services: Implementation of folder redirection using Group Policy Objects (GPOs) and deployment of an IT Department web page using IIS.
